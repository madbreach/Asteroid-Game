# Asteroids
By running Asteroids.java, a game will appear that uses the keys on a keyboard to move a ship back and forth. Random objects bounce into screen and the ship can shoot the bullets into the incoming object.

This project was developed and worked on in Intro to Data Structures from Westminster College. 

This project taught me the importance of an iterative work. Although there were tough challenges in getting this program to function the way I would have liked it, it taught me that sometimes it is better to submit an iteration that is mildly unfinished and continue to grow it into something great than to give up.
